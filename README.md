# google-geolocation-api

I think my future self will thank me for writing this code to track the position of the ISS ( International Space Station ).

This code gets the updated cardinal coordinates i.e actual location of the inernational space station(ISS) which moves very fast at about 28000km/h via the ISS api, The codes opens the live google map position of the space station in a chrome browser. The last time i ran this code the ISS was somewhere in Tajikistan :)
