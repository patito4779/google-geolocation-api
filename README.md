# google-geolocation-api

I think my future self will thank me for writing this script and attempting to track the position of the ISS ( International Space Station ).
Though the last part of the script is still a little bug, for whatever reason which i do not understand with google search and its escaping of the + character from the complete search parameter. Hopefully a fix to this will be found either by me or someone else.

This code gets the updated location of the inernational space station which moves very fast at about 28000km/h via the ISS api and then the cardinal coordinate location is parsed into the google geolocation api to give us the actual readable physical location of the ISS via a web browser.
